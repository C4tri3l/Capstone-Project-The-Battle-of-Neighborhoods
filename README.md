# Capstone-Project-The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods

1) Introduction/Business Problem

The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location. First of all, we need to collect data from all the coffee shops in Toronto, including their name, ID, location (address, latitude, longitude) and then find the "hot" neighbor where most of the place is located. For active data we use FourSquare and apply folium to visualize a particular neighbor in which we will observe customer "traffic" and predict the proper location of a new coffee shop in the city. In this case, you will find your temporary name on the folium map, “New Coffee!”

2) Data
I will use foursquare data about coffees in Toronto. Foursquare is a US tech company from New York focusing on location data. Their technology and data powers apps such as Apple's Maps, Uber, Twitter and many other household names.

3) Methodology
We will locate which neighborhoods have the highest coffee density. We will need a location where we can locate the customers of the "hot" location that we have mapped and remain at a distance to decrease the competitiveness of the company. For this purpose, we will use the Folium tool.

4) Results
We can clearly see on the map where the cafes are located, with their hottest areas highlighted as the image is zoomed. From that, we choose a location area for the new coffee, which is close to the very center of the city and within a logical radius of its current competition.

5) Discussion
From the initial display of the map, we realized that most of the coffee shops in Toronto are located on the Avenues. For this reason, it seemed correct to us to locate the new venture, in the hot zone, but not on any avenue.

6) Conclusion
This report can be useful for someone planning to open a restaurant in Toronto, when comparing current bargains and neighborhood profiles, however it may not cover all variables such as access to public transportation or even profiles of restaurants, so it will not be used as a single decision-making tool. It will be a very good starting point analyzing the possible and probable area of investment placement.
